   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.
.. Each entry under the autosummary directive has stubs generated automatically
   and placed in the autosummary subfolder. This subfolder must be deleted so that
   the files are refreshed (my make script takes care of this)   

Welcome to Wiggly's documentation!
